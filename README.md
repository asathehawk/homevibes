Description: An application to search for local real estate listings.
Reactjs is utilized to process data dynamically and render components
within the DOM. The workflow includes Webpack, SASS, Gulp, and use
of the CLI.


Programmed a filtering and sorting component that utilizes
JavaScript functions to iterate through real estate listings and
display a view based on criteria such as location, number of
bedrooms, and extra features.

Connected the listing view component to modular logic that
dynamically pulls data from a JSON file using state, lifecycles, and
props to render two types of grid-like views.


Utilized the use of task runners like Gulp, bundlers, CSS
preprocessors and Browsersync to automate repetitive tasks
while reducing time taken for module testing.
